## Im Tired asf

### To Do:
- Need to decrement number of seeds when planting plants
- Need to fix water decay so it happens every second, not every frame (Plant.Update): This will probably fix the issue of plants not being visible on FarmTiles.

### Improvements:
- Fix problem of the farmer rotating on its own after certain animations
- Warning in console: `'Player' AnimationEvent 'NewEvent' on animation 'Watering' has no receiver! Are you missing a component?`
